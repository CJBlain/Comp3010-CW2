**Introduction:** 
An SOC (Security Operations Centre), serves as a central hub for monitoring, detecting, analysing and responding to real time cyber secuity threats. The Botsv3 dataset that has been used in this report allows you to practise these skills. The dataset simualtes a security incident at a fake brewing company called frothy. The datset provides the user with a wide range of logs, these range from emails to to network endpoints. on top of all of that, the BOTSv3 Dataset also includes logs from cloud services such a amazon web services and microsft azure.

The Primary purpose of the investation will be to analyse anolomises related to AWS and answer the set of level 200 questions. 


**SOC Roles & Incident Handling Reflection:**


**Installation & Data Preparation:**
The envirmmoment to complete this exercise was swtup to closely miror real world SOC lab infrastructure. 
Host: VMware Workstation Pro 17 on Windows 11 host
Guest OS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS Desktop (64-bit)
Resources allocated: 8 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM, 120 GB dynamic disk

The reasons for allocating the amount of disk space and RAM was to ensure perfomance when loading the dataset was not an issue. As well as this, when i was investigating the dataset i ddi not want to have to wait ages everytime i searched.
